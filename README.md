# Just a brief explanation about the gs- that precedes the name of the repository...

It is as much a reference to my first and last name as it is to Generic Systems, because the repository was created with the intention that anyone with a need for such a solution and the necessary knowledge can use this project, **which has the MIT license included**, as they wish. If you have any questions about how MIT License works **[click here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit)** and if they still persist, contact me.
